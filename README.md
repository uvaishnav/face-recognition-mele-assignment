## üìä Implementation Overview

### 1. üìÑ Data Preparation [view notebook](data_preparation.ipynb)   
   - **Libraries:** MTCNN, PIL, Pandas, NumPy
   - **Steps:**
     - Load and inspect the dataset.
     - Use MTCNN to detect and extract faces from images.
     - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
     - Address class imbalance through data augmentation.
   - **Reasoning:** MTCNN is chosen for its accuracy and reliability in face detection, ensuring high-quality face extraction for subsequent recognition tasks.

### 2. ü§ñ‚öôÔ∏è Model Training   [view notebook](model_training_ensemble.ipynb)
   - **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, DeepFace
   - **Steps:**
     - Load and preprocess images using `ImageDataGenerator`.
     - Utilize transfer learning models Facenet and OpenFace for feature extraction.
     - Ensemble these models using stacking by adding a meta-learner on top of the predictions of these two models.
     - This will learn the optimal way to combine the predictions from FaceNet and OpenFace Models.
     - Train the model with early stopping, l2 regularization, Dropout to prevent overfitting.
   - **Reasoning:** Transfer learning with Facenet and OpenFace leverages pre-trained models known for excellent face recognition performance, thus reducing training time and improving accuracy.

### 3. üìà Model Evaluation
   - **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Steps:**
     - Evaluate the model on the test set.
     - Generate and visualize the confusion matrix.
     - Produce a classification report detailing precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - **Reasoning:** Using comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations helps in understanding the model's performance and areas of improvement.


## üé≠ Face Recognition Web Application Overview

### Initial Work
As discussed in the Implementation Overview, we have developed a face recognition model by leveraging transfer learning and ensemble techniques using state-of-the-art pretrained models like FaceNet and OpenFace. This model is trained to identify 31 different celebrities. 
- üìä [Sample Prediction](sample_prediction.ipynb)

### Building the Application
We have a meta-learner that can take features from FaceNet and OpenFace to effectively identify celebrities. To use it for an application, we need to design a clear pipeline that:
1. **Predicts Celebrity Identity**:
   - Takes an input image
   - Extracts features
   - Returns predictions

Our application must also facilitate adding an image of a new person for future recognition. The pipeline should:
2. **Store Embeddings for New Users**:
   - Take an input image
   - Extract features
   - Store embeddings

3. **Recognize Persons Based on Stored Embeddings**:
   - Take an input image
   - Extract features
   - Recognize the person based on stored embeddings

We have implemented a `FaceRecognizer` class to handle all these tasks.  üß© [View Code](predictor.py)

### Features of the Application
- üì• **Upload Images of New Users**: Store their embeddings for future recognition.
- üîç **Recognize Persons**: Identify persons based on stored embeddings.
- üåü **User celebrity Match**: Our meta-learner, trained to classify given images among 31 celebrities, can predict the celebrity that the user's facial features most closely resemble. **This is a fun feature to enhance user interaction with the application.**

To handle backend routes, we have used the Flask framework. üß© [View Code](app.py)
