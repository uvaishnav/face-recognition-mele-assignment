## üìä Implementation Overview

### 1. üìÑ Data Preparation [view notebook](data_preparation.ipynb)   
   - **Libraries:** MTCNN, PIL, Pandas, NumPy
   - **Steps:**
     - Load and inspect the dataset.
     - Use MTCNN to detect and extract faces from images.
     - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
     - Address class imbalance through data augmentation.
   - **Reasoning:** MTCNN is chosen for its accuracy and reliability in face detection, ensuring high-quality face extraction for subsequent recognition tasks.

### 2. ü§ñ‚öôÔ∏è Model Training   [view notebook](model_training_ensemble.ipynb)
   - **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, DeepFace
   - **Steps:**
     - Load and preprocess images using `ImageDataGenerator`.
     - Utilize transfer learning models Facenet and OpenFace for feature extraction.
     - Ensemble these models using stacking by adding a meta-learner on top of the predictions of these two models.
     - This will learn the optimal way to combine the predictions from FaceNet and OpenFace Models.
     - Train the model with early stopping, l2 regularization, Dropout to prevent overfitting.
   - **Reasoning:** Transfer learning with Facenet and OpenFace leverages pre-trained models known for excellent face recognition performance, thus reducing training time and improving accuracy.
